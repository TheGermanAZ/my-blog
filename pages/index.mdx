Hi I am German Alvarez, I was an Economics student at UC Davis before I took a couple of classes in computer science and liked every aspect of it.

I then decided to teach myself how to make web apps in javascript after a short stint of making python backends. Currently I am learning how to make graphql based webapps and have been learning more about DSA.
